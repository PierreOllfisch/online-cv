    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      Hi, I am Pierre, born in Germany, 27 years old and am currently finishing my masters degree in aeronautical engineering. 
      My thesis  was about the preliminary sizing of electric STOL aircraft concepts and refactoring the used software. 
      My bachelor degree was in automotive engineering, where my thesis was about finding manufacturing methods for a shaft hub connection made out of composite
      materials.
      My digital skills encompass scripting languages (MATLAB, VBA). 
      Furthermore i have experience in the simulation tools ANSYS WORKBENCH (FEM), Dassault CATIA (FEM) and STAR-CCM+ (CFD).
      Outside of work i enjoy flying gliders and motor gliders.
